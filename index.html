        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a second-year student at UC Riverside, majoring in Education, Human Development, and Society. This fall, I am excited to be interning with Create Thirst Academy, where I have the opportunity to immerse myself in the educational field. Through this internship, I have developed essential skills in lesson planning, adapting to changes, and gaining a deeper understanding of the teaching environment while working directly with children. Each day presents new challenges and learning experiences that strengthen my commitment to becoming an effective educator. 

My passion for working with kids began at a young age. I started babysitting when I was just a child myself, which sparked my interest in education and child development. Over the years, I actively sought opportunities to engage with students in various settings. These experiences not only reinforced my love for teaching but also deepened my understanding of the complexities within the school system and the various pedagogical approaches that can be employed to support diverse learners. <br><br>

        Currently, I am focusing on understanding the pressing issues faced by both public and private schools. I have become familiar with the systemic challenges that many educational institutions encounter, including funding disparities, resource allocation, and the impact of socio-economic factors on student achievement. This knowledge has opened my eyes to the importance of advocacy in education, and I am determined to make a meaningful impact in addressing these issues. 

Growing up in a low-income community, I can relate to the struggles that many students face today. My background has shaped my perspective on education and its accessibility. I understand firsthand the barriers that can hinder a childâ€™s ability to succeed academically, such as limited access to resources, extracurricular activities, and supportive educational environments. These experiences have fueled my passion for creating inclusive and equitable learning opportunities for all students, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds. <br><br>

        I believe that education is not just about imparting knowledge; it is about fostering a supportive environment where students feel valued and empowered. As a critical thinker, I appreciate the importance of collaboration and learning from others in the field. I actively seek mentorship and guidance from educators and peers, recognizing that diverse perspectives enrich my understanding of teaching practices and student needs. 

In pursuit of my teaching credentials, I am committed to not only improving my own skills but also advocating for systemic changes that promote equity in education. I aspire to be a teacher who not only instructs but also inspires and uplifts my students. My goal is to create a classroom culture that celebrates diversity and encourages critical thinking, creativity, and resilience. 

Looking ahead, I am excited about the opportunities that lie before me in the field of education. I am eager to continue learning and growing, both personally and professionally, and to contribute positively to the lives of my future students. Through my experiences and education, I hope to be part of a movement that addresses educational inequities and fosters a more just and inclusive society.
